You are attempting to use Flash Attention 2.0 without specifying a torch dtype. This might lead to unexpected behaviour

You set `add_prefix_space`. The tokenizer needs to be converted from the slow tokenizers
You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565
